The Algorithms course and these assignments covered the following concepts:

  - Searching
  - Sorting
  - Recursion
  - Divide and Conquer
  - DFS, BFS, and Floodfill
  - Dynamic Programming
  
  For these assignments, I used Java and Python although it was mostly Python.

Anyway, the following concepts were covered:

 - Arrays
