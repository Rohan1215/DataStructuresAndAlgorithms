# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms courses at UCSD & HSE. 

The Algorithms course and these assignments covered the following concepts:

  - Searching
  - Sorting
  - Recursion
  - Divide and Conquer
  - DFS, BFS, and Floodfill
  - Dynamic Programming
  
  For these assignments, I used Java and Python although it was mostly Python.

Although I have not completed the Data Structures course since I didn't have time before lmao, I have experience with these data structures. 
Anyway, the following concepts were covered:

 - Arrays
 - Stacks
 - Linked Lists
 - Queues
 - Priority Queues
 - Disjoint Sets
 - Hash Tables - still left
 - Binary Search Trees - still left
 - AVL trees - still left


Pretty great course. It is a college-level course with a lot of math and analysis, but I highly recommend it.
